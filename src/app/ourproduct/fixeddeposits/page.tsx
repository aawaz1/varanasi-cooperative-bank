      <li>      The interest should generally be computed at quarterly or larger rests and not on monthly basis as per the directives of the Reserve Bank of India. However, if monthly payment of interest is insisted upon by any depositor, branches may agree to do so, provided that the amount of interest paid every month is not more than the discounted value of the interest for one month so that even if interest is allowed on the interest so paid, the aggregate interest amount paid would not exceed one monthâ€™s interest on the deposit calculated on a quarterly basis.
      </li>
      <li>The interest on deposits repayable within six months (short term deposits) should be paid for the actual number of days on the basis of 365 days in a year. On deposits repayable after six months and where the terminal month is incomplete, interest should be paid for the completed months on a actual months basis and for the incomplete month on the actual number of days of the deposit in that month on the basis of 365 days in a year. When the deposit is repayable after six months and where the terminal month is complete, the interest should be paid on the basis of actual months completed.
      </li>
      <li>Loan facility is available against pledge of FDR receipts observing the prescribed procedure for such loans.</li>
